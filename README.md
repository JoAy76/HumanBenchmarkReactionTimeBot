**This bot will auto click the screen when it detects certain rgb values. This script requires the following prerequisites:**

- **PIP3**
- **PIL/Pillow**

No other testing on other platforms has been done. Use software at your own discretion.

**Additional Information**  
This software will auto-install the required modules for the software.  
If you need to stop the program use the key interrupt (CTRL + C)  
Larger Image Grab sizers will slow down the bot as it has more surface area to scan.
