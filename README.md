# Image Grab Pixel Clicker

**This bot will auto click the screen when it detects certain rgb values. This script requires the following prerequisites:**
- **Python 3.7.2 or high (duh)**
- **PIP3**
- **PIL/Pillow**
- **Pyscreenshot**
- **Pynput**
- **Currently, Windows is the only compatible Operating System**

This software will auto-install the required modules for the software.

If you need to stop the program use the key interrupt (CTRL + C)

**Larger Image Grab sizers will slow down the bot as it has more surface area to scan.**
If you need to contact me or want to suggest any changes please contact me @ admin@josephambayec.dev

**VERSION: 3.1.0 Alpha**
