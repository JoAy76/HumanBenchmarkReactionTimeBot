# Image Grab Pixel Clicker

**This bot will auto click the screen when it detects certain rgb values. This script requires the following prerequisites:**
- **Python 3.7.2 or high (duh)**
- **PIP**
- **PIL (Python Image Library/Pillow)**
- **Pynput**

**To get these modules use the following commands in your command prompt:**
- **pip install Pillow**
- **pip install pynput**


On windows, selecting these commands and pasting them in the command prompt will install all modules one at a time!.

After installing these module, open the python file via double clicking, using command line or using the python IDLE.


If you need to stop the program use the key interrupt (CTRL + C)

**Larger Image Grab sizers will slow down the bot as it has more surface area to scan.**

**FINALLY! IF YOU SEE OUTPUT IN THE COMMAND PROMPT LIKE NONE OR (0,0) IT MEANS ITS WORKING! NOW JUST MAKE SURE THE HUMAN BENCHMARK TAB IS OPEN AND IS IN FULL SCREEN!**

If you need to contact me or want to suggest any changes please contact me @ admin@josephambaye.dev

**VERSION: 2.0.0 Alpha**
