This bot will auto click the screen when green or blue pops up allowing for a lower time and higher score. This script requires the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.7.2 or high (duh)
- PIP
- PIL (Python Image Library/Pillow)
- Pynput

To get these modules use the following commands in your command prompt:
- pip install Pillow
- pip install pynput 


On windows, selecting these commands and pasting them in the command prompt will install all modules one at a time!.

After installing these module, open the python file via double clicking, using command line or using the python IDLE.

**NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE THE HUMAN BENCHMARK TAB OPENED FULL AND NOTHING CAN BE BLOCK THE PAGE INCLUDING THE COMMAND PROMPT! IF THE COMMAND PROMPT IS BLOCKING THE PAGE IT WILL NOT WORK! ALT-TAB TO THE BROWSER IF NEEDED TO HIDE THE COMMAND PROMPT!**

If you need to stop the program use the key interrupt (CTRL + C)

If you want to use this for other purposes, you can edit screengrab sizes, rgb values and more! RGB Values might need to be adjusted!

**NOTE: THIS SCRIPT/BOT TAKES A SCREENSHOT OF ONE PIXEL ON THE SCREEN! THIS PIXEL CAN BE CONFIGURABLE IN THE IDLE. TO CHANGE THE VALUES OF SCREENGRAB HERE'S A GUIDE:**

To change size of screengrab, edit (bbox(sx, sy, ex, ey))

These stand for start-x start-y and end-x end-y! **(CHANGING THIS MAY SLOW DOWN THE BOT)**

**FINALLY! IF YOU SEE OUTPUT IN THE COMMAND PROMPT LIKE NONE OR (0,0) IT MEANS ITS WORKING! NOW JUST MAKE SURE THE HUMAN BENCHMARK TAB IS OPEN AND IS IN FULL SCREEN!**
